Overview
In this project, we aimed to maximize the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) score for our Speech Emotion Recognition task by using an ensemble of multiple classifiers.

What We Did
* We trained and evaluated several classifiers individually.
* To boost overall performance, we experimented with various ensemble combinations of these models.
* The attached results and code reflect multiple ensemble strategies, where predictions from individual classifiers were combined.
* Our final submission is based on the ensemble setup that yielded the highest ARI score on our validation data.
